 <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> We know that Christianity (including Protestant and Catholic) is the biggest religion in the US. I have heard people saying that two-thirds of Americans are Christians. However, based on my experience and understanding, I think only a small proportion of Christians would agree that their faith is relevant to daily lives. What I mean is that they believe in Biblical teachings and they actively practice their faith. Therefore, I want to see how Christianity plays a role in the lives of believers.

     <h3>Hypothesis: The link between Christian affiliation and believing in fundamentals of Christian values is not strong enough to be identifiable. </h3>
    <p> I got data from Religious Landscape Studies by Pew Research Center, and the study collected survey reponses from over 35000 respondents. The questions are about religious background and opinions on religion-related topics. I selected parts of the data, and I generated new data using pivot table.</p>
