    <p>The first graph tells the religious background of 35071 respondents.15842 of them are protestant. 7196 of them are Catholic. It shows that about two-thirds of people are Christians.</p>
    <p>The second graphs asks about moral guidance when it comes to questions of right and wrong. Most respondents chose "Practical Experience and Common Sense". The second largest portion is "Religious Teachings". Considering that two-thirds of respondents are Christians, we can see that a decent number of Christians did not choose religious teachings as their moral guidance.</p>
    <p>The third question asks Christian respondents about their prayer activity.Surprisingly, the number of people who never pray for once is overwelming. That is 75.7% by calculation. Only 2557 of 25048 respondents pray at least once a week. </p>
    <p>Overall, based on the data we have, I can conclude that approximately half of the Christians in the US seek moral guidance from the Bible. And only a tiny portion of Christians (10% according to the study) pray regularly. This means that most Christians in the US place their faith as a secondary role in their lives. </p>
